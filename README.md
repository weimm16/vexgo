# VexGo

## How to run

- go
- nodejs
- pnpm

### Security Configuration

For production deployment, it's highly recommended to set the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a strong, random secret:

```bash
export JWT_SECRET="your-very-long-random-secret-here"
```

If not set, the application will generate a random secret at startup for development purposes. Never use the default development secret in production.
